#Bootstrap practice with Newsweek
This is an [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/using-bootstrap?ref=lnav) by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home).  The idea is to practice using bootstrap with a homage to the [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com) website.  Any images or content from that website is copyright to Newsweek.
